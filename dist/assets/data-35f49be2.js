It was created by me and both of my friends, Ali and Ojan. I and Ali participated as the UX Designer and Ojan as the UX Researcher. The research of this project was carried out by interviewing a few friends from our group and was conducted online due to the pandemic.","First, we did a brainstorm to zoom out of the given topic. It was done to make it easier to determine the discussion for ideation. And we define food and health as our living space. Then we perform a problem search from the linkup space that we have specified. And it was found that many obese people are still confused about having suitable and optimal diet. After that, we started doing research and also doing interviews. In the next stage, I did a medium-fidelity design to facilitate the following design process. And then I continued the hi-fi design with my friends.","Conducting interviews during this pandemic is a challenge that occurs because of the lack of essence that we can achieve. In the end, we conducted online interviews using video call and chat interviews.

The project was conducted by me and both of my colleges, Luthfi and Ikhsan. In the team, I worked as the front-end developer and UI designer. Luthfi worked as the full-stack developer and Ikhsan as the back-end developer.","In the project, we used agile development because it helps us to iterate every work that has to be improved. First of all, we started to do research on the people in the Dramaga. We used the double diamond method to complete the project. After that, we started to make the flows of the app. As we started the research I started learning to create the website from scratch. I had been exploring from the start of the project for a few months, so as soon as the development time comes, I’ll just implement the knowledge I had learned before.","In the end, we deployed the web and submitted our project to be scored. In this project, telling other workers to make the same kind of style in design and CSS is quite a challenge. Eventually, we had meetings to talk about the style guide and the CSS and discussed it while we were implementing it.
